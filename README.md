# CinemaSpringBoot

This is a site for movie theater, union of my two previous projects (<a href="https://github.com/msndie/FWA">FWA</a> and <a href="https://github.com/msndie/Cinema">Cinema</a>).
- Now users has roles
- remember-me functionality which can be enabled on signIn page
- site has two languages (Russian and English)
- back end validation for signUp page with errors for each field
- email verification for new users

In this project we use:
- Spring Controllers
- Spring security
- Hibernate with Spring Data Jpa (with custom repos. to solve n+1 problem)
- Ajax-requests for live search on films page
- Spring Websockets for chats
- JavaMailSender
- FreeMarker as template engine.
