# CinemaSpringBoot

This is a site for movie theater, union of my two previous projects (<a href="https://github.com/msndie/FWA">FWA</a> and <a href="https://github.com/msndie/Cinema">Cinema</a>).
- Now users has roles
- remember-me functionality which can be enabled on signIn page
- site has two languages (Russian and English)
- backend validation for signUp page with errors for each field
- email verification for new users

In this project we use:
- Spring Controllers
- Spring security
- Hibernate with Spring Data Jpa (with custom repos. to solve n+1 problem)
- Ajax-requests for live search on films page
- Spring Websockets for chats
- JavaMailSender
- FreeMarker as template engine.

# Launch
You need to create an empty database in postgres.

Go to ```ex02``` folder and write your credentials in <a href="https://github.com/msndie/CinemaSpringBoot/blob/main/ex02/Cinema/src/main/resources/application.properties" target="_blank">```application.properties```</a> file and change path to folder where images will be stored.

Then you can just use the following command to run the application
```
./mvnw clean spring-boot:run
```

Now website available on <b>localhost:8080</b>. You can access it through ADMIN account (email - <b>admin@admin.com</b> pass - <b>123QWEasd</b>)
Or you can create new account, it will send an email on address that you provide, but not really, actually email will be available on <a href="https://ethereal.email">this website</a>. You need to put following credentials to get it
